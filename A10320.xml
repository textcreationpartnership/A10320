            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>CHRISTIAN reader, when I had peruÅ¿ed this Å¿ermon made by M. Downame, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the honorable function of Bbs, as he Å¿aith, &amp; Å¿awe that it tended directly to prove, that the Caling of our L. Bbs. (as they now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciÅ¿e it in the Church of England) is not onely <hi>lavvfull &amp; good;</hi> but alÅ¿o to be holden, <hi>jure diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no;</hi> not as an humane ordinance, their ancient &amp; wonted tenure, but by devine right, as the verie &amp; ymediate ordinance of ChriÅ¿t: I deemed it as needfull to be anÅ¿wered, as any book our OppoÅ¿ites have at any time Å¿ett forth. For how ever M. D. affirmeth the doctrine therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined, <hi>to be not onely true, but a profitable &amp; neceÅ¿Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rie truth,</hi> and that in the judgment of all men, which are <hi>not partiall &amp; full of preiudice:</hi> it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that it is a doctrine vtterlie falÅ¿e, verie hurtfull &amp; obnoxius, neceÅ¿Å¿arie in deed, to be confuted, at no hand to be beleeued: doctrine, repugnant to the truth, the word of the truth, Å¿cripture of truth, contrarie to the judgment and practyce, of the prime Churches next after

Others would be much Å¿candalized; thoÅ¿e that were in love with their owne eaÅ¿e, would eaÅ¿ily crouch downe lik IÅ¿achars AÅ¿Å¿e, and Å¿eeing that reÅ¿te is good, would readily &amp; without exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, imbrace his doctrine Å¿oe pleaÅ¿ing to the fleÅ¿he: as for others, it would <hi>remoras obijcere ardentioribus,</hi> caÅ¿t blocks in their waie whoÅ¿e hearts were upright with God, and ran well, &amp; Å¿oe mak themÅ¿t and at the gaze like the CorpÅ¿es of AÅ¿ael &amp; AmaÅ¿a: or <hi>retardare zelum,</hi> make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> Å¿lack their pace: at leÅ¿te <hi>Å¿anctorum Å¿piritus in quie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tare</hi>

TheÅ¿e things conÅ¿idered, my hearts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿yre and praier to God was, that he would raiÅ¿e up Å¿ome man, like MoÅ¿es to Å¿tand in the gapp, &amp; by Å¿ome Å¿hort &amp; Å¿ound anÅ¿were, to make up the breach he had made, and waytinge for the performance of it, the newes was: that work was vndertaken and in hand; but anÅ¿were, and preÅ¿Å¿e, &amp; printer, and concealer of the author, were taken and impriÅ¿Å¿onned, as dealers againÅ¿t the Å¿tate. Thus was my Å¿oule caÅ¿te downe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in me, to Å¿ee a truth, Å¿oe profitable &amp; neceÅ¿Å¿arie a truth Å¿uppreÅ¿Å¿ed.

What Å¿hall we Å¿aie then to M. Downame, &amp; what Å¿mell is he lik to giue, who in this his preface, hath as many dead flies almoÅ¿t as Å¿enten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. It is directed <hi>to the ChriÅ¿tian reader,</hi> the matter concerneth ChriÅ¿tianitie, the author a much reÅ¿pected ChriÅ¿tian; &amp; yet Å¿carce one Å¿entence theirof, but Å¿oe vnchriÅ¿tianly written, that had not G. D. Å¿ubÅ¿cribed it, we could never have deemed M. D. the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of it. It was expected of all that know him, that though he writ of the Å¿ame Å¿ubject, which other his predeceÅ¿Å¿ours have done; yet, as lead by another Å¿pirit, he would have take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> another courÅ¿e; &amp; by his myld &amp; moderate dealing, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>demned them for Å¿harpening their toungs, to make their words cutt as the raÅ¿or, &amp; pearÅ¿e vnto the heart lik the prickings of the Å¿word: but he Å¿urpaÅ¿Å¿eth, at leÅ¿te doth paralell, &amp; Å¿oe doth juÅ¿tifie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> all. In deed, he covereth with another coveringe, &amp; maketh another Å¿hewe, then they have done: but when his plaites Å¿halbe vnfolded and he vncovered, I doubt not (ChriÅ¿tian reader) but thou wilt readily &amp; <hi>ex animo</hi> Å¿ubÅ¿cribe my Å¿entence. Lett us therefore come to it. All that he Å¿aith in this his preface maie well be referred to four heades. The firÅ¿t is his perÅ¿waÅ¿ion grounded upon reaÅ¿on, that whoÅ¿oever read his Å¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon without prejudice, cannot but beleeve and imbrace the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine therein taught, as <hi>a truth profitable and neceÅ¿Å¿arie</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>teyned fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> the begininge to the middeÅ¿t of page 4. The Å¿econd, is <hi>a deÅ¿crip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion of the Å¿inguler god, that will immediately followe upon the belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinge and imbracing thereof,</hi> from thence to middeÅ¿t of page 8. The third is a <hi>double exhortation drawne from the premiÅ¿Å¿es,</hi> from thence
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:15958:7"/>to the laÅ¿t Å¿entence. The fourth is, his concluÅ¿ion with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teÅ¿tation.</p>
            <p>His perÅ¿waÅ¿ion he laieth downe in the beginninge where he telleth us, that he is <hi>not ignorant how vnpleaÅ¿ing his Å¿ermon will be to Å¿ome, who are foreÅ¿talled with preiudicate opinions, (whom he could wish he were as Å¿ure to perÅ¿wade, as he hopeth by evidence of truth to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince;) and that if he maie intreate us, to read it without preiudice, and to iudge of it without partiallitie, he doubteth not,</hi> but that <hi>we will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge with him, that the doctrine therein conteyned is not onely true, but alÅ¿o a profit able and neceÅ¿Å¿arie truth.</hi> The which in effect he repeateth againe in the latter end of this firÅ¿t head. For anÅ¿were wherevnto, (not to examine him what might be the reaÅ¿on of this complaint, whether the corrupt meaÅ¿uring of other mens mindes by his owne affections, as they now Å¿tande towards them &amp; their writings that differ from him; or the remembrance of his former paÅ¿Å¿ions, what time he himÅ¿elf was diÅ¿pleaÅ¿ed with them that Å¿pake againÅ¿t him, when he walked in another maie then now he doth; or his feare (being privie to the weaknes of his cauÅ¿e) that Å¿ome will too narrowly Å¿ifte and trie his Å¿ermon, if they be not frighted from it by Å¿ome Å¿uch prefaces; not to examin him I Å¿aie herof but leaving it to himÅ¿elf, not to his pen but to his conÅ¿cience to decid) I muÅ¿te tell him; firÅ¿t that if the prejudice he chargeth upon others, had not blinded his owne eyes, he might well have Å¿eene, how much he miÅ¿taketh the matter, when he Å¿aith, he is <hi>not ignorant how vnpleaÅ¿ing his Å¿ermon willbe to Å¿ome &amp;c.</hi> He cannot be ignorant, that if he hath done the deed he boaÅ¿teth of, &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that which he intended therein, none in this kingdome will more applaud this Å¿ermon, &amp; gratulate him with his labours, then thoÅ¿e Å¿ome, whom, he Å¿aith, it wilbe moÅ¿te vnpleaÅ¿ing vnto: con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>Å¿idering how deare a price they have payd, and Å¿tand yet indebted to paie for not being of his mind. A farr greater (I Å¿uppoÅ¿e) then
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:15958:7"/>can be imagined he or any of his Å¿yd will ever diÅ¿burÅ¿e for it. Purt caÅ¿e, the caÅ¿e Å¿hould alter, Å¿hall we think he or they will abid Å¿uÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penÅ¿ion, deprivation, degradation, excomunication &amp; impriÅ¿Å¿on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for this doctrine conteined in his Å¿ermon; as Å¿ome of us have done for the truth we holde? Secondly, that he dealeth not verie charitablie, in chargeing all thoÅ¿e that are not of his mind, <hi>to be Å¿oe foreÅ¿talled with preiudicate opinions, that though, by evidence of truth they be convinced, yet they will not be perÅ¿waded.</hi> What is this els, but to proclaime them to be men,
<note place="margin">1 <hi>TheÅ¿.</hi> 5.21.</note> without conÅ¿cience and care <hi>to try all things and keep that which is good?</hi> yea to be Å¿uch, as againÅ¿t light &amp; cheke of heart, are reÅ¿olued to goe on in evill, even Å¿ould to the defence of error &amp; obÅ¿tinacie? we are often thus charged in this preface, but if he be not able to inÅ¿tance, upon his owne know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge in Å¿ome of us, thaz we have Å¿hewed our Å¿elues obÅ¿tinate in Å¿ome errors, wherof we have bin convicted; himÅ¿elf is the man that is foreÅ¿talled with prejudice: and in deed Å¿oe Å¿ick of this diÅ¿ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿e, that it maie well be Å¿ayd to him, <hi>medite cura teipÅ¿um, hypocrite, first caÅ¿te the beame out of thyne owne eye.</hi> For were he as Å¿ound ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of as he would Å¿eeme to be, he could never have charged (as he doth in the next words) all thoÅ¿e that read his Å¿ermon, &amp; doe not aÅ¿Å¿ent thereto without contradiction, Å¿traitewaies acknowledging the doctrine therein conteined to be true, yea a profitable and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿arie truth: <hi>to read it with preiudice, &amp; iudge of it with partiallity.</hi> A verie hard condition layd upon the reader, and an vncharitable taxe of thowÅ¿ands in this lande. Thirdly, he boaÅ¿teth as vainely of himÅ¿elf, as he Å¿peaketh vncharitablie of others, for wherevnto tend his words but to tell us, that he is the man, that hath dryven the naile to the head &amp; Å¿troke all dead; Å¿o farre excelling all that writte or Å¿pak before him, in bringing light out of darknes, that all thoÅ¿e who wilfully Å¿hutt not their cies, muÅ¿t needs, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge with him that for true which is in deed utterly falÅ¿e. Shall
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:15958:8"/>we think M. D. writeth as he thinketh? And that if the DiÅ¿cipline we Å¿tand for, were not (but the government by our Bbs. in Å¿tead therof) under the croÅ¿Å¿e, and he Å¿hould be (as others are) deprived of all he hath for holding the Å¿ame: Å¿hall we thinke he would then make Å¿uch a Å¿ermon, and print it with Å¿uch boaÅ¿ting, that all muÅ¿t needs acknowledg it for truth, yea for a profitable and neceÅ¿Å¿arie truth; or elÅ¿e they read it with prejudice, and judge of it with par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialitie? M. D. muÅ¿t give us leave to doubt of it; he cannot be igno<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rant that there are manie amongÅ¿t us, who Å¿avour the Bbs. calings Å¿oe farre as to allow them a place in the Church, and therefore ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be charged with the prejudice and partiallity he Å¿peaketh of, who yet nether doe (nor are likely ever to) acknowledg this his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to be as he Å¿aith, a profitable and neceÅ¿Å¿arie truth. His rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on therefore, wheron he groundeth his perÅ¿uaÅ¿ion, had need to be pregnant, or elÅ¿e it is but a vaine preÅ¿umption. Let us heare it, <hi>I the rather conceyve this hope</hi> (Å¿aith he) <hi>becauÅ¿e the time hath bin, when myne affection inclined by the reverent opinion I had worthily conceyved not onely of M.

The which for a longe tyme I did forbeare &amp;c.</hi> Loe here his reaÅ¿on; would one think that Å¿oe skillfull a workman could buylde Å¿oe Å¿tronge hope (as not to doubt of it) upon Å¿o weake a ground; that becauÅ¿e himÅ¿elf (prejudiced by the reverent opinion he had of thoÅ¿e worthy men) <hi>once doubted till he had Å¿eriouÅ¿ly entred into the Å¿tudy thereof;</hi> therefore all others that <hi>reade his Å¿ermo without preiudice,</hi> will forthwith and vvithout doubt <hi>acknovvledge the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine therein conteined to be true, yea a profitable and neceÅ¿Å¿arie truth?</hi> Can a man lovve in his ovvne eies, Å¿o highely eÅ¿teeme of his ovvn learning, as to think more to preveile by one little Å¿ermon; then
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:15958:8"/>all his PredeceÅ¿Å¿ours of all degrees, Arch. Bbs. Bbs. Deanes and Doctors, by their large, moÅ¿te accurate and learned treatiÅ¿Å¿es, have bin able to doe? to buyld Å¿uch caÅ¿tles in the ayer, had more become Å¿uch a light head as M. G. P. then Å¿o grave advivine as M. G. D. hath Å¿emed to be. And did the reuerent opinion of thoÅ¿e godly &amp; learned men, make him to Å¿uÅ¿pend his judgment herein? Å¿oe he Å¿aith; Å¿oe alÅ¿o did the creditt of the firÅ¿t devyÅ¿ers Å¿omewhat amaze Bb. BilÅ¿on himÅ¿elf as he telleth us;
<note n="(b)" place="margin">in his pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>face to his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet: gou:</note> maie we beleve them? did the reuerence and credit of thoÅ¿e worthies, Å¿oe farr preveile with Å¿uch great men as theÅ¿e, as to amaze the one, and occaÅ¿ion the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, of longe tyme to Å¿uÅ¿pend his judgment? what merveile then, if the authoritie, of the Å¿ame men, &amp; all Å¿oundly reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in the world, doe incline us, (whom M. D. thinketh many waies inferior to himÅ¿elf) to be of their judgment, or as leÅ¿tewyÅ¿e to Å¿uÅ¿pende it, till we can Å¿ee more pregnant proofes then have yet bin produced to the contrarie? And Å¿urely, did the Bbs. in their proceedings, or M. D. in his writings, uÅ¿e that moderation which their places and profeÅ¿Å¿ion require; they Å¿hould deale much more favourablie with us, then they doe: Å¿eing if we erre, are we alone? have we not thoÅ¿e godly and learned men of our Å¿yd, by the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of whom our AdverÅ¿aries themÅ¿elves have Å¿tood at a Å¿taie for a time? And if M. D. proofes be not (as he affirmeth) pregnant and plentifull in deed; Å¿hall we not doe well, to be wel advyÅ¿ed, before we forÅ¿ake that cauÅ¿e, which hath Å¿oe manie godly and lear<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned patrones &amp; fautors, as <hi>are Å¿ound, admirably Å¿ound, and orthodoxall in the Å¿ubstanciall points of religion</hi> as himÅ¿elf afterwards confeÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿eth? verily we cannot be Å¿oe partiall as to reuerence and admire them in all other pointes of doctrine: and yet deÅ¿piÅ¿e them in this of the diÅ¿cipline as M.

            <pb n="16" facs="tcp:15958:9"/>
            <p>But in this Å¿entence of his, I charge him with Å¿lauder on the one Å¿yd, &amp; Å¿uÅ¿pect him of vntruth on the other. He maketh M. Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin the author of the diÅ¿cipline, (as <hi>Saravia, Bb. BilÅ¿on, D. Kinge</hi> &amp; others have done before him) how Å¿landereth he the cauÅ¿e of God, Å¿oe making it the divice of man? that Calvin Å¿hould deviÅ¿e it &amp; thruÅ¿t it upon the Church for Gods ordinance; what a notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous evil chargeth he vpon that man, whom he would Å¿eeme to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence? Oh that M. D. him Å¿elf were not guiltie of that Å¿in in this Å¿ermon teaching the gouernment by our L. Bbs. to be Gods or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, which is in deed of mans devyÅ¿inge. M. Calvin was Å¿oe farr from being the devyÅ¿er of the diÅ¿cipline we Å¿tand for, that he vvas not Å¿o much as the firÅ¿t preacher and publiÅ¿her of it, no not in theÅ¿e later ages. <hi>Wicliff, Hus, Luther, Zuinglius,</hi> &amp; others before him, brought the Å¿ame to light, though not Å¿oe clearely and fully in all the partes thereof, as Å¿hall in the anÅ¿vvere appeare. That he Å¿uÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended his judgment for along time, maie juÅ¿tly be Å¿uÅ¿pected of vntruth. They that have knovvne him in times paÅ¿t, (from the time of his entrance into the MiniÅ¿try till he became Doctor eÅ¿pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially) conceyved othervviÅ¿e of him, then of one that Å¿uÅ¿pended his judgment in his cauÅ¿e; and that not vvithout cauÅ¿e, if his vvri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings and note bookes vvere Å¿eene, &amp; he vvould but tell us, vvhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he never Å¿upplicated to any for the furtherane therof. But be it true that he did as he Å¿aith, maie vve not juÅ¿tlie charge upon him the neglect of his dutie; in that he entred into the MiniÅ¿terie, and took one lyving after another and that with Å¿ubÅ¿cription (for ought is knovvne to the contrarie) and yet held the matter in Å¿uÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence a longe tyme, &amp; reÅ¿olued not to be (as he afrervvard Å¿aith) a meddler on either Å¿yd? But to proced; he giueth us tvvo reaÅ¿ons (Å¿uch as they be) for his excuÅ¿e; The firÅ¿t is, <hi>he rightly Å¿uppoÅ¿ed</hi> (as he Å¿aith) <hi>his paines might be better beÅ¿towed in other parts of divinitie.</hi> And vvhy Å¿oe? doth he not affirm this parte to be a <hi>profitable and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:15958:9"/>neceÅ¿Å¿arie truth?</hi> And hath not God commanded to his MiniÅ¿ters eÅ¿pecially the Å¿tudie, as of everie parte of his will: Å¿oe of this Å¿oe profitable &amp; neceÅ¿Å¿arie a truth, as concerneth the government of his Church, the MiniÅ¿ters and Officers therof? Yea can the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ters more profitably beÅ¿towe their paines &amp; Å¿tudie, then in theÅ¿e pointes of divinitie, that are moÅ¿te doubted of, &amp; controverted in the Church, vvherof they are members? Yea, are they not bound to it, when the cauÅ¿e Å¿oe Å¿tandeth that they muÅ¿t Å¿ubÅ¿cribe to the one, and that the moÅ¿te Å¿uÅ¿pected Å¿ide, even Å¿uch as the moÅ¿te and beÅ¿te learned in the vvorld approve not? Whether this Å¿uppoÅ¿itio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> of his be right (as he Å¿aith) or no, lett the vvorld judge. But to give it the more credit, he telleth us, <hi>how he heard M. Greenham a zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Preacher reprove yonge divines in a Å¿ermon at Cambridge &amp;c, for Å¿etting up the roofe, before they had layd the foundation.</hi> Al as poore man, vvhat Å¿uccour is there under this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>s shadovv? Yf M. Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham Å¿oe cenÅ¿ured all yonge divines for Å¿tudying the DiÅ¿cipline, vvhereto can it be imputed, but to Å¿ome diÅ¿tempered paÅ¿Å¿ion, or zeale vvithout judgment in him? not to anie Å¿ound reaÅ¿on Å¿urely, yf vve conÅ¿ider the matter vvell. Was there not greater reaÅ¿on for him, to reprove the Prelates, for urginge yonge divines to Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cribe, to the DiÅ¿cipline in controverÅ¿y, and Å¿eeking reÅ¿olution in it? Have not yonge divines juÅ¿te cauÅ¿e to Å¿tudie it, vvhen Å¿eing it controverted amongÅ¿t manie &amp; great divines old and nevve, they muÅ¿t notvvithÅ¿tanding beforced to Å¿ubÅ¿cribe, and thereby to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove that parte, vvhich they know to be contrarie to the judgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t of the greateÅ¿t lights, that theÅ¿e later ages have affoarded the Chur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ches of God? Is it not Å¿trange, they can be contented men Å¿hould, (naie will they not condemne them if they doe not) Å¿ubÅ¿cribe to that as true; and yet blame them, yf they Å¿tudie the Å¿ame and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min whether it be true or no? what is it elÅ¿e, but vvith the blinde PapiÅ¿ts, to make ignorance the Mother of Devotion, even to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:15958:10"/>as the Church beleeveth, and good enough? yea what elÅ¿e is it, but to controule the courÅ¿es of our owne, and all vniuerÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the world, who require of yonge divines, the publique de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of controverÅ¿ies of religion, in open Å¿chooles, &amp; aÅ¿Å¿emblies of learned men, and yet denie them the Å¿tudie, of theÅ¿e controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ies that trouble our owne Church, though they be deemed not to befoe deep and profound, as other controuerÅ¿ies are; but Å¿uch <hi>as eaÅ¿ynes it Å¿elf</hi> (if we maie beleeve M. Hooker) <hi>hath onely made harde?</hi> But the truth is, that yonge divines indure no Å¿uch cenÅ¿ure, in caÅ¿e they Å¿o Å¿tudie theÅ¿e matters of diÅ¿cipline, that they can learne to preach and diÅ¿pute and raile againÅ¿t them in pulpitts and Å¿chooles: naie, they are the onely men, that are judged to laie the beÅ¿t foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, &amp; pave the readieÅ¿t waie for their owne preferment.

In his Å¿econd reaÅ¿on he telleth us, <hi>he could not Å¿ee what good would come either to himÅ¿elf or to the Church of God, by his paines taken in that controuerÅ¿y, For he conceyved the iÅ¿Å¿ue of his Å¿tudie would be, either the diÅ¿grace of his MiniÅ¿terie amonge the forwarder Å¿ort, if he reÅ¿olued as no whe hath done: or the ouerthrowe of his Ministerie, if he should Å¿tand for that diÅ¿cipline.</hi> Wherein, beÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des his vncharitablenes renued, mark how he diÅ¿couereth one Å¿hame whileÅ¿t he aÅ¿Å¿aieth to cover another. What elÅ¿e can it argue, but that he walked not in the execution of his function with Å¿oe right a foote and Å¿yncere affection as he ought to have done; had he made Å¿treight Å¿tepps to his pathes, he would have reÅ¿pected, not Å¿o much the grace of men, how holie and forward in Å¿hew Å¿oeuer; as the diÅ¿charge of that office, which God impoÅ¿ed on him, &amp; is to be parformed without reÅ¿pect of parÅ¿ons. And is it any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but a vaine and ambitious minde, Å¿oe to feare the diÅ¿pleaÅ¿ing of Å¿ome, and the diÅ¿grace of his MiniÅ¿try with them, as in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:15958:10"/>to forbeare of alonge tyme, the Å¿carching out of that divine truth, which himÅ¿elf affirmeth to be both profitable &amp; neceÅ¿Å¿arie? Of as ill note is it, that he refuÅ¿ed Å¿oe to doe, for Å¿eare leÅ¿te in Å¿eing the truth &amp; profeÅ¿Å¿ing it, <hi>it would be the ouerthrowe of his MiniÅ¿tert:</hi> can this be any better then Symonie and intruÅ¿ion? had not G.

But obÅ¿erue we Å¿ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, hovv he vvrongeth thoÅ¿e vvhom he calleth in a kind of diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deine, <hi>the forwarder Å¿ort</hi> as though the MiniÅ¿terie of thoÅ¿e onely that diÅ¿lik the preÅ¿ent government, vvere in grace vvith them: &amp; the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿terie of all others vvere contemned &amp; diÅ¿piÅ¿ed of them; Å¿oe his vvords importe, though vncharitablie. For hovvever, the forvvar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Å¿ort, (that is, Å¿uch as goe before others in vvelldoing) vvould lik the better of thoÅ¿e MiniÅ¿ters that approue of the preÅ¿ent gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yf they vvere of judgment for the diÅ¿cipline of ChriÅ¿t: yet Å¿o longe as they Å¿hevve themÅ¿elves faithfull &amp; painefull in all other duties of their MiniÅ¿terie, and doe not Å¿in of mallice in rayling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t it; all the vvorld Å¿eeth, hovv they yeild due reverence vnto them, &amp; their MiniÅ¿terie.

The firÅ¿t is to unitie and peace, layd downe in many words, the breife whereof is, <hi>that we would fynde argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to reunite our Å¿elves, &amp; yf the proofes he hath brought in his Å¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon overweye our reaÅ¿ons, we would ingeniouÅ¿ly acknowledg the truth.</hi> And becauÅ¿e he thinks, that feare of diÅ¿credit maie hinder it, he taketh it awaie by three reaÅ¿ons; firÅ¿t, <hi>from the remembrance of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>s comon frailty, which is Å¿ubiect to over Å¿ight: Secondly from the revere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>d opinion worthily conceyved of M. Calvin, Beza and other Divines. Thirdly, from the conceite of the good effects of the DiÅ¿cipline deÅ¿ired, &amp; evill of the eÅ¿tablished;</hi> In this firÅ¿t exhortation I moÅ¿t willing joyne with him, and doe earneÅ¿tly praie him, and charge him in the L. as he will anÅ¿were it at that laÅ¿t and dreadfull daie; that he would in deed Å¿eek the peace of Sion, and be as deÅ¿yrous to uÅ¿e meanes to reunite himÅ¿elf and the reÅ¿te to us, and the reformed Churches; as he hath bin in this Sermon overbuÅ¿y in Å¿eeking rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>Å¿ons to disjoine himÅ¿elf and others from us, and them; and that he would weigh in the ballance of an unpartiall judgment the anÅ¿weres brought to his proofes, and if he fynde them to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weigh his reaÅ¿ons, he would give glorie to God, by acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging ingenuouÅ¿ly Å¿oe profitable, and as theÅ¿e tymes are, Å¿o ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿arie a truth. And that according to his owne doctrine in his former Sermon, of the great neceÅ¿Å¿ity of the Å¿ound and Å¿yncere preaching of the GoÅ¿pell, he would by all meanes labour, that it maie have free paÅ¿Å¿age, that the people which periÅ¿h for want of knowledge, maie be taught the vvaie of Å¿alvation, that all true labourers in the word and doctrine, maie have the double honot he Å¿peaketh of, &amp; be cheerished as bees in the hyve; &amp; that all Loy terers maie be chaÅ¿ed from it as drones; that vaine titles maie not
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:15958:27"/>anÅ¿were for painfull offices &amp; duties: that garments, compleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ts &amp; Å¿hadowes maie not be preÅ¿Å¿ed and preferred before Å¿ubÅ¿tances, that the hearts of the rightuous maie be made no longer Å¿add for vvelldoinge, nor the hands of the vvicked confermed &amp; Å¿trenght<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in evill. This is the ready waie to true peace &amp; vnitie, by this meanes vve Å¿hall meet togither in one, vnited &amp; revnited one to another: godlines vvill floriÅ¿h, athiÅ¿m &amp; papiÅ¿me vvill be putt to flight, the popiÅ¿h hope &amp; expectation of a change vvill be cruÅ¿hed, the mouthes that Å¿peak proud things wilbe Å¿topped, God vvilbe our God, our Sheild, our Buckler, our CaÅ¿tle and Defence, vve shalbe his people, &amp; shall not need to feare any mallice of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verÅ¿aryes hovv many, hovv mighty, how cruelly &amp; malliciouÅ¿ly, Å¿ett &amp; bent againÅ¿t us Å¿oever they be: much leÅ¿Å¿e the feare of diÅ¿cre ditt he Å¿peaketh of. Where becauÅ¿e as it Å¿eemeth, he judgeth of our eÅ¿tate, by the feeling he hath of his ovvne pulÅ¿t, it shall not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿Å¿e to returne him home his ovvne reaÅ¿ons vvith exchange of a fevv words: and therefore doe tell him, firÅ¿t he shall not need to feare diÅ¿creditt, by making open acknovvledgment of his errors, diÅ¿couered in this anÅ¿vvere &amp; the hurt he hath done thereby: For the beÅ¿t maie erre, &amp; it is a work of grace fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> God &amp; creditt vvith men to confeÅ¿Å¿e them. Yf it vvere a diÅ¿creditt: yet it shall be good for him vvith Ierom <hi>plus conÅ¿cienciae, quam nomini deferre,</hi> to reÅ¿pect his conÅ¿cience more then his creditt. The reverent opinion vve have vvorthily conceyved of thoÅ¿e vvorthy divines, hath moved us in deed the rather to imbrace the diÅ¿cipline vve Å¿tand for: &amp; vve had good reaÅ¿on for it Å¿eing God hath bleÅ¿Å¿ed them Å¿oe exceeding abundantly, in all Å¿pirituall knovvledge and vnderÅ¿tanding, that (their &amp; our aduerÅ¿aries being Iudges) <hi>they are found admirably Å¿ound &amp; orthodoxall in the Å¿ubÅ¿tanciall pointes of religion.</hi> Yett have vve not Å¿oe relied upon their creditts, as not to Å¿earch into, &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine upon vvhat grounds they &amp; vve Å¿tand as too manie of the other Å¿yd, vvho in their Å¿implicitie (preÅ¿uminge upon the vviÅ¿do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>e
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:15958:28"/>and Å¿ynceritie of the Bbs. whom they Å¿uppoÅ¿ed would require no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but what they might Å¿afely yeld vnto) have relied on their creditts &amp; putt to their hands &amp; names, they knew not to what; that fault therefore which in this Å¿econd reaÅ¿on he extenuareth in us, is greater in them &amp; had the more need be confeÅ¿Å¿ed by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>. As for the effects of both which in his 3. reaÅ¿on he Å¿peaketh of, we muÅ¿t needs acknowledge they have had their effects vvith us.</p>
            <p>The vnÅ¿peakeable good, vvhich that diÅ¿cipline, that he calleth <hi>newe</hi> &amp; vve <hi>olde</hi> &amp; <hi>ancient,</hi> hath yelded to the Churches imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceing it, the vvhich alÅ¿o, vve are perÅ¿vvaded, it vvill affoard us vvhenever vve receyve it, cannot but vvork effectually in us an earneÅ¿t deÅ¿yer &amp; longing after it; as the manifold corruptions in doctrine &amp; manners, taxes, troubles and vexations for vvell doing, vvhether ariÅ¿ing from the perÅ¿onall defaults of the gouernours, or nature of the gouernment it Å¿elf; (not here to be diÅ¿puted of) but cleaving Å¿oe inÅ¿eperablie to it, that Å¿oe longe as the one remeineth vve cannot expecte any freedome from the other; hath made the IÅ¿rael of God to grone vnto him for eaÅ¿e &amp; deliuerance from it.</p>
            <p>As for the horrible confuÅ¿ions, vvhich vvould inevitably follovve if <hi>the diÅ¿cipline</hi> (as he Å¿arcaÅ¿tically calleth it) <hi>of the ne weÅ¿t edition</hi> vvere eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed, vvhereby he vvould leÅ¿Å¿en the corruptions of our tymes; as he Å¿peaketh of that he knovveth not: Å¿oe vvhen he telleth us vvhat they are, he Å¿hall receyve his anÅ¿vvere. Thus much for his firÅ¿t exhortation, his Å¿econd follovveth, to vvit, that in cauÅ¿e his arguments in this Å¿ermon, <hi>through our preiudice &amp; partial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity Å¿eeme light to us, and we yeild not to them; that then our anÅ¿weres maie be diÅ¿tinctly applyed to euery argument in order, with pregnant &amp; demonÅ¿trative proofes, &amp; then he will acknowledge his error, onely he deÅ¿yreth ChriÅ¿tian &amp; modeÅ¿te dealinge, not Å¿uch as is in that book called, the ChriÅ¿tian &amp; modeÅ¿t offer.</hi> Wherein, (to paÅ¿Å¿e by the repeating of Å¿ome things before Å¿poken of, here againe mentioned, &amp; namely the Å¿lander of ChriÅ¿t diÅ¿cipline, in Å¿aying <hi>it was neuer heard of till
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:15958:28"/>now of late, &amp; that our gouernment by Bbs. hath bin perpetually obÅ¿erued in the Church euer Å¿ince the ApoÅ¿tles tymes,</hi> the falÅ¿hood of both vvhich pointes hath bin &amp; Å¿halbe at large diÅ¿couered) vve have 3 things to be obÅ¿erved: firÅ¿t a diÅ¿yre of an anÅ¿vvere; 2. the conditions required; 3. a promyÅ¿e. Yf vve turne not vvith him, his deÅ¿yre is, vve vvould returne him an anÅ¿vvere, <hi>a diÅ¿tincte anÅ¿wer to all his arguments in order.</hi> So doe the Doctors of Oxford in their anÅ¿vvere to the peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the 1000 MiniÅ¿ters; Å¿o doth G.

A hard condition of each Å¿yd, but of the two, we will chooÅ¿e the eaÅ¿yer,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:15958:29"/>rather then by Å¿ilence to betraye the truth, by juÅ¿te apologie, what euer it coÅ¿te us, to mainteine it, yf you will have us to deÅ¿iÅ¿te from anÅ¿weringe; doe not you propound againÅ¿t us, laye you aÅ¿yde your Å¿words, we will Å¿oone laie by our targetts: otherwiÅ¿e yf though you firÅ¿t provok us to Å¿peak and then puniÅ¿h us; know you it is not the feare of puniÅ¿hment that shall fright us, the truth, which is the life of our life, is more deare vnto us. Thus much for his deÅ¿yre or challenge, his conditions followe and they are two. In the firÅ¿t he requireth that <hi>we diÅ¿tinctly apply our anÅ¿weres to euery of his arguments in order, with proofs pregnant and demonÅ¿tratyve.</hi> Which I acknowledge but reaÅ¿on; and had he dealt Å¿oe with us in his Å¿ermon, we should have giuen him no anÅ¿were: but his carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing awaie the matter in tryvmph, with diÅ¿courÅ¿es, gueÅ¿Å¿es, fancies, counterfeit writers, wittneÅ¿Å¿es borne out of oue time, not old e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough by 2 or 3 hundred yeares (Å¿ome of them) to giue wittnes to his cauÅ¿e, his forced interpretations of Å¿criptures and Fathers devy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed of purpos, and vvith great Å¿treme of vvit, to putt by the truth, his equiuocations, frivolous and looÅ¿e collections, vvherof vve have good Å¿tore in his Å¿ermon, (as their anÅ¿were shall shevve) none of vvhich vvill beare a Å¿yllogiÅ¿me, nor abyd the hammering vpon the right anvyle: theÅ¿e courÅ¿es I Å¿aye can vve not allovv for proofes pregnant and demonÅ¿tratyve. As for this anÅ¿vvere, I refer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re it to the Reader to judge vvhether the demonÅ¿trations therein, be not Å¿ound, the proofes pregnant, and the arguments Å¿trongely grounded upon the Å¿cripture, vvith plaine interpretations, &amp; Å¿uch as have conÅ¿ent, not of Å¿ome fevve olde and nevve vvriters onely: but almoÅ¿t of all divines Å¿ound and orthodoxall in all Å¿ubÅ¿tanciall points of religion: yea admirable for their vvritings in queÅ¿tions tvvixt us and the papiÅ¿ts.

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:15958:29"/>In his Å¿econd Condition, he requireth more <hi>ChriÅ¿tian and modeÅ¿t dealing,</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> in that book called the <hi>ChriÅ¿tian &amp; modeÅ¿t offer,</hi> which faith he, <hi>notwithstanding that title is full of odious CenÅ¿ures, proud &amp; Å¿cornefull Å¿peaches, vnchriÅ¿tia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> &amp; immodeÅ¿t provocations great bitternes &amp; gall &amp;c.</hi> Yf it Å¿hould be Å¿oe, which nether hath he Å¿hewed, nor can I acknowledge, yet lett the ChriÅ¿tian reader compare that their book, with this his preface, and I dout not but he will Å¿aie <hi>turpe est doctori &amp;c.</hi> it is a foul fault in a teacher, to be deeplier guil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty of the fault him Å¿elf, then the partie he blameth.
